# hidden-markov-model-analysis
Hidden Markov model time series data analysis for stock data.
This program is an improved version of the Matlab version found in the pdf. Main improved features are support for 4 state Normal HMM, graphing returns of FTSE 100. I also made additions to connect to stock broker API (Alpaca Markets) and fetch real time data for stock evaluation. Just place your API KEY and SECRET API KEY in the alpaca_connector.py script.
